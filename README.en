INFORMATION about the online-mode is at the end of this file.

noad is a program for advertising-detection in vdr-recordings. It uses the 
station-logos for the detetction and produces cutting-marks for the recording.

You can use noad as a standalone-program or in conjunction with 
vdr (use option --recording in vdr).

The logo-detection is based on a program from Thorsten Janke, the original 
program and the diplma thesis(in German) can be found 
here: http://www.ktet.fh-muenster.de/ina/node1.html.

noad works in three passes. First pass is the logo-detection. Second pass is a 
logo-scan over the recording and sets marks whenever the logo disappears. 
In the third pass, noad tries to refine the marks using e.g. detection of 
blacklines at the top and bottom of the pictures.
Another option is to find repeating sequences before and after the break and 
move the marks depending on found repeats.
Since Version 0.4.0 there is also an (experimental) option to use sound-switching 
for ad-detection. This is based on the thesis that advertsing is never send in 
dolby-digital. If you call noad with the parameter --ac3, it checks for ac3-sound 
in the recording. If ac3-sound is found, the first pass will be done by sound-switch 
detection, which is sometimes faster than the logo-scan.

noad is written for ad-detection on german tv-stations. Other countries may have other 
kinds of advertising, so you have to check by yourself if noad can be helpfull for you.

Install:
Before you can build noad, you have to install libmpeg2(version 0.3.1 or newer,see http://libmpeg2.sourceforge.net) 
and/or ffmpeg
If you hav installed libmpeg2/ffmpeg, just call configure/make/make install.

Running noad:
noad [options] cmd <record>
options:
-s <filename>   --statisticfile=<file>
                name of the file for statistic-data
-v              --verbose
                increments the log-level, can be given multiple
-b              --background
                start noad as backround-process
-p              --priority
                priority when running as background-process [20...-20] default is 20
-c              --comments
                adds comments to the marks in marks.vdr
-o              --overlap
                try to detect repeating sequences before and after the break
-a              --ac3
                experimentel: use ac3-sound for ad-detection
-j              --jumplogo
                looks for vertikac drifted logos
-O              --OSD
                sends an OSD-Message to the running VDR-instance(localhost:2001) for Start and End
-S              --savelogo
                saves the detected logo for later usage
-B              --backupmarks
                saves an existing marks.vdr to marks0.vdr
-n              --nelonen
                  special behavior for finish stations
-V              --version
                shows the Version and exits

               --svdrphost=<ip-address>
                 set the IP-address used for OSD Messages
                 (default: localhost)
               --svdrpport=<tcp-port>
                 set the TCP-Port used for OSD Messages
                 (default: 2001)\n"

                --markfile=<markfilename>
                set a different markfile-name
                
                --online[=1|2] (default is 1)
                  start noad immediately when called with "before" as cmd
                  if online is 1, noad starts online for live-recordings
                  only, online=2 starts noad online for every recording
                  live-recordings are identified by having a '@' in the filename
                  so the entry 'Mark instant recording' in the menu 'Setup - Recording'
                  of the vdr should be set to 'yes'

                --asd
                  audio silence detection
                  you have to compile noad with ffmpeg-support to use this (see configure --help)


                --decoder=libmpeg2|ffmpeg (default ist ffmpeg if possible)
                  choose Video-Decoder
                
cmd: one of
       before      given from vdr, if used with the Option "-r" in vdr 
                   noad exits immidiatly with this command
       after       given from vdr, if used with the Option "-r" in vdr 
                   noad starts the scan
       deleted     given from vdr, if used with the Option "-r" in vdr 
                   noad looks for a running instance of noad for this
                   recording and stop it
       -           dummy-parameter if called directly
       nice        noad runs with low priority
<record>    complete path of the recording that should be scanned


Examples:
  direct call, scan with normal priority:
  noad - /video/Akte_x/2003-07-18.22.08.50.50.rec

  direct call, scan with normal priority, write statistic-data to /video/noadstat:
  noad --statisticfile=/video/noadstat -/video/Akte_x/2003-07-18.22.08.50.50.rec

  direct call, run as background-process with low priority:
  noad nice --background /video/Akte_X/Roland/2003-08-22.22.03.99.99.rec

  Usage in conjunction with vdr:
  vdr -r'noad [options]'

HINT: noad needs write-acces into the recording-directory!

Usage with VDR:
noad can be called automatically from vdr after a recording is finished if vdr is started with
the additional parameter -r'noad....'. If your system automatic shuts down after a recording, you should 
take care that noad has done its work before shutting down the machine.
Another way to use noad is an entry in the reccmds.conf, so that you can call noad via the recording-menu
of vdr.
Examples:
call vdr so that noad is started after each recording:
vdr <other vdr-Parameter> -r'/usr/local/src/noad-0.4.1/noad --statisticfile=/video0/noadstat'
HINT: noad and its parameter have to be enclosed in single quotes.
HINT: Don't give a cmd-parameter here, this will be done automatically by vdr!

Entry in reccmds.conf:
ad-scan: /usr/local/src/noad/noad nice --background -O -C -a -j --statisticfile=/video0/noadstat'
HINT: You have to give a cmd-parameter here (nice oder -), and there MUST be the --background given,
         else your vdr-watchdog will restart your vdr after some time!
 

For working on your existing recordings, there are the following 3 scripts:
allnoad
allnoad <videodir> [additional_noad_args]
  calls noad with the cmd "-" for all recordings in the dir <videodir>
  Example:
  allnoad /video --statisticfile=/video/noadstat -v

allnoadnice
allnoadnice <videodir> [noad-args]
  calls noad with the cmd "nice" for all recordings in the dir <videodir>
  Example:
  allnoadnice /video --statisticfile=/video/noadstat --verbose --verbose

allnewnoad
allnewnoad - <videodir>  [additional_noad_args]
  or
allnewnoad nice <videodir>  [additional_noad_args]
  calls noad with the cmd "-" or "nice" for all uncutted recordings in the dir <videodir>
  where no marks.vdr exists. This script needs the helperscript "noadifnew"
  
These three scripts schould never be called withe the parameter "--background", else there is 
a new instance of noad started for each recording!


Statistics:
If you call noad with "--statisticfile=<file>", some statistical data will be written into this file. 
There will be a single line for each scanned recording. The last field of this line contains the text
"add your comment here". This field can be used to add your comments about the succes of the scanning.
Don't insert any newlines into this field! With the script "stat2html" these datas can be converted into 
HTML-Format. Have a look into "mystat.html" to see how what information is provided.

online-mode -- how does it work?
If you want to run noad during the recording you hav to give the additional parameter '--online'. In this case
noad starts scanning even if it is called with 'before' as the first parameter. If you just give '--online', the 
online-scan will only be done if the current recording is an instant-recording. noad recognises this on the '@' in the 
recording filename. This will only work if you have the entry 'Mark instant recording' in the menu 'Setup - Recording'
set to yes (which is the default). If you want to run noad online on every recording you have to give '--online=2'.
If noad is called from vdr with the cmd 'before', the recording-directory doesn't exist, so noad waits 60 seconds
to let vdr create the directories. After that there is another delay until the first 3000 Frames (2 Minutes)  are 
recorded. At this time noad starts the logo-detection (or the ac3-detection if the parameter '--ac3' is given).
If the logo or a sound-change is detected, the first mark is set. From now on noad goes sleeping and wakes up
every 15 second and scans the newly recorded frames.
If you call noad with '--overlap' the overlap-detection will be done 250 seconds after an on-mark is found.
If there are no new frames recorded for a while noad stops.

noad vs noad
If you call noad in the usual way via the '-r'-parameter of vdr it will be called twice, before and after the 
recording. In this case the online-scan is still running at time the normal scan starts. If noad detects this there
will be a delay up to 6 minutes to wait for the online-scan to end. After that, noad tries to stop the online-scan 
via signal. AFter that the normal scan will be done. This behavior is implemented because the marks found in 
online-mode might be not so good as the marks found in the normal scan. To let this work correctly noad has to be 
called with the same online-parameters in both calls.

noad online and vdr
If you want to see a recording in timeshift-mode without ad's you have to patch your vdr to let this work.
The mark-file has to be cyclic reloaded to use the marks found by the online-scan. Also the jumpplay-patch, which 
is used to skip the marks during replay, has to be extended so it doesn't stop after the last mark.
An extended jumpplay-patch can be found on the noad homepage. The patch is for vdr-1.3.7, if you use another 
version of vdr you have to do the necessary changes by yourself.
If you want to see a complete recording in timeshift-mode you should start your replay with a delay between
15 and 30 Minutes.

Hint:
The online-scan is currently under construction. Check out the usability for your needs, there may be improvements 
in the future. If you encounter any problems, please report to me.
The statistik-values are not cerrect in the online-mode, so if you use the noad statistic feature you should
use different statisc-files for the online-mode and the normal scans. This can be done by calling noad via 
a helper-script which sets different parameters for the different noad-calls. An example how this can be done is 
included (see noadcall.sh).

noad 0.6.0:
asd - audio silence detection
Sometimes there are short audio breaks between different clips. noad can detect these short breaks and (somtimes) use 
them to distinct between advertising/trailers and the normal recording. 
To use this feature you need an installed libavcodec from ffmpeg. You have to configure noad with  "--with-ffmpeg",
and may give the pathes to the include- and libryr-files with "--with-ffmpeginclude" and "--with-ffmpeglibdir".
At this time, asd isn't integrated in the online-scan.

noad 0.8.0:
decoder - choose video-decoder
You can choose between libmpeg2 or libavcodec(ffmpeg) as video-decoder. Default is ffmpeg if possible. If you choose libmpeg2 and
noad detects a hd-video ffmpeg will be used if possible.

noad 0.8.5:
New tool "checkMarks" for checking the marks for a recording.
Due to an error in the 0.8.x-Versions there can be marks on non-IFrames. To identify those recordings there is now a 
tool for checking the marks.
To find all recordings with faulty marks there is a scrip called "checkAllMarks". This script has to be called with
a vdr-video-directory as parameter. It searches all recordings in that dir and checks them with checkMarks.
If necessary, recordings with faulty marks will be rescanned with the curent noad-programm.
